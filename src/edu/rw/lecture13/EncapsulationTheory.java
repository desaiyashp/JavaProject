public class EncapsulationTheory {
//    Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit
//    We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.
//    We can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
//    The 'Java Bean' class is the example of a fully encapsulated class
/*    Advantages:
        - It provides the control over the data
        - We can make the class read-only or write-only.
        - It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
        - The encapsulated class is easy to create and test.
