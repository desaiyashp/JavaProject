    Construction is similar to Method
    But,  name of constructor is always the same as class name.
          Does not require return type.
          It cannot be static, Abstract
          Access modifier is always public -- (good practice is not to use any access modifier, use default/without any modifier)
          when we create an object, it automatically calls the constructor.
          For multiple objects, it calls multiple time the constructor.
          Multiple constructors can be created in a class using different parameter data types.
          There is a default constructor provided by JVM,

          Why do we use constructors?
